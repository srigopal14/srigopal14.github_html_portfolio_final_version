        <li>For the final project, I wanted to create a mashup with 2 to 3 mediums learned in the class. 
          Mashup without a story line is of no value and therefore I created a theme around sports. Given the excitement about the FIFA world cup in Santa Clara Levis Stadium in 2026, I decided to create a short video on the "Priceless Moments" in soccer. 
          My goal was to show a player kicking the soccer ball as a 3D model with the goalkeeper failing to save the goal. I used different frame rates to create a slow motion effect of the goal. 
          Then I rendered the 3D animation with shadows, proper lighting, and blended background to bring a realistic touch. Fans go crazy when a goal is scored and accordingly, I captured the moment with an animated 3D rendering of "Gooal" using Adobe After Effects.  
          Next, I wanted to give some enhanced effect by adding the glitch effect on the "Gooal" image. I used Photoshop to edit the image, playing with texture. I displaced the characters of the word and distorted the image with new layers. Then, I brought the glitch effect to the audience’s reaction. 
          I uploaded an audience photo cheering in a soccer game and then used Photoshop to create the glitch effect. I created new layers to move the audience image sideways for the glitch. My objective was to transition from a clear image to a glitch image and then to a clear image. 
          In my mind, it highlights the immense excitement fans have when watching their team score a goal. Next, based on the professor’s suggestion, I added another 3D rendering of the goal, but in a different direction, depicting the opponent scoring a goal.  
          Next, I introduced a new medium code for art using p5.js, to show the fan cheering the goal. I loved coding with p5.js as it creates a wonderful medium to showcase your imagination with shapes. I decided to include a simple art of fan cheering with hands going up and down. 
          I coded different shapes of the body, hands, pants, and shirt using p5.js. Finally, I combined Blender 3D rendering, glitch images, Gooal animation from After Effects, and p5.js image in iMovie to create a 20-second video. I also added a text animation at the end called “Priceless Moments” that conveys the emotional connection of the game and the excited audience.  
          I enjoyed the video output about showcasing 3 different art media (learned in the class) and displaying them in a theme. I am eager to see the feedback from my peers.
